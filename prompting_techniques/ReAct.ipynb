    "El paradigma **ReAct (Reason + Act)** propuesto por **Google**, permite combinar las **capacidad de razonamiento** (ya presentes en tÃ©cnicas como **CoT**), con la **capacidad de actuar** sobre un medio externo.

It consist of a hereditary monarch that reigns as the head of state, being the highest office of the country. The current monarch is Felipe VI since 19 June 2014, after the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos I.\n",
      "The Spanish monarchy is constitutionally referred to as The Crown (Spanish: La Corona), and it comprises the reigning monarch, his or her royal family, and the Royal Household, which supports and facilitates the sovereign in the exercise of his duties and prerogatives. The Royal Family is currently represented by King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia, their daughters Leonor, Princess of Asturias, and Infanta SofÃ­a, and the king's parents, King Juan Carlos and Queen SofÃ­a.\n",
      "The Spanish Constitution of 1978 re-established a constitutional monarchy as the form of government for Spain after the end of the Francoist regime and the restoration of democracy in 1977. The 1978 constitution affirmed the role of the king of Spain as the living personification and embodiment of the Spanish State and a symbol of Spain's enduring unity and permanence and is also invested as the \"arbitrator and the moderator\" of Spanish state institutions. Constitutionally, the king is the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces. The constitution codifies the use of royal styles and titulary, Royal Prerogatives, hereditary succession to the crown, compensation, and a regency-guardianship contingency in cases of the monarch's minority or incapacitation. According to the constitution, the monarch is also instrumental in promoting relations with the \"nations of its historical community\". The king of Spain serves as the president of the Organization of Ibero-American States, representing over 700,000,000 people in twenty-four member nations worldwide. Spain and Monaco are the last remaining monarchies on the European Mediterranean coast.\n",
      "The Spanish monarchy has its roots in the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo founded after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Then the Kingdom of Asturias fought the Reconquista following the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the 8th century. A dynastic marriage between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon (the \"Catholic Monarchs\") united Spain in the 15th century. The Spanish Empire became one of the first global powers as Isabella and Ferdinand funded Christopher Columbus's exploratory voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The sea route he established paved the way for the Spanish conquest of much of the Americas.\n",
      "As of 2021, the official budget for the Spanish monarchy is 8.4 million euros, one of the lowest public expenditures for the institution of monarchy in Europe. However, other expenses of the royal house are assumed by different government departments.\u001b[0m\n",

He is best known as the director, writer and producer of the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001â€“2003) and the Hobbit trilogy (2012â€“2014), both of which are adapted from the novels of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien.

He is the fourth-highest-grossing film director of all-time, his films having made over $6.5 billion worldwide.Jackson began his career with the \"splatstick\" horror comedy Bad Taste (1987) and the black comedy Meet the Feebles (1989) before filming the zombie comedy Braindead (1992). He shared a nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay with his partner Fran Walsh for Heavenly Creatures, which brought him to mainstream prominence in the film industry. Jackson has been awarded three Academy Awards for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. His other awards include three BAFTAs, a Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmy Awards and four Saturn Awards among others.\n",
      "His production company is WingNut Films, and his most regular collaborators are co-writers and producers Walsh and Philippa Boyens.

In the storyline, Ned is the lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Though the character is established as the main character in the novel and the first season of the TV adaptation, a plot twist involving Ned near the end of the novel and the end of the first season shocked both readers of the book and viewers of the TV series.Ned is portrayed by veteran English actor Sean Bean in the first season of Game of Thrones, as a child by Sebastian Croft in the sixth season and as a young adult by Robert Aramayo in the sixth and seventh seasons. Bean was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television and a Scream Award for Best Fantasy Actor for the role.
