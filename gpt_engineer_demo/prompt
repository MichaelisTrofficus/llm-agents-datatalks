You are going to train a Matrix Factorization algorithm on a fake ratings matrix  using Pytorch.
Use torch.utils.data.Dataset and torch.utils.data.Dataloader to process the data.
Add logs and print statements for monitoring in the console.
Use tqdm when running the for loop of epochs.
Save the model into this path './model.pth'

An example of the ratings matrix is the following:

user_id  items_id  rating
int32    int32     float32
0        0         4.0
1        5         2.0

You have to create the fake ratings matrix following the structure above.
The ratings matrix should have, at least, 1000 rows.
The user_ids must range randomly from 0 to 999.
The item_ids must range randomly from 0 to 999.
Use 100 as the number of factors.

Use torch==2.1.0,pandas==2.1.2 and scikit-learn==1.3.2 numpy==1.26.1
Use python 3.10.11
