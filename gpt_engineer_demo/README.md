Let's start by creating the necessary files and directories. We will need the following files:

1. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the necessary packages that need to be installed.
2. `src/data.py`: This file will contain the code to generate the fake ratings matrix and the custom Dataset class.
3. `src/model.py`: This file will contain the code for the Matrix Factorization model.
4. `src/train.py`: This file will be the entry point of our program. It will contain the code to train the model and save it.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
